<p class="text-box"> You as an individual have multiple ways in which you can help a foodbank, the main amongst them is via donations of food or money. The most obvious one is donating food. Normally foodbanks will accept whatever food is donated to them, however they usually have a list of items that they would rather have. You can find that on a foodbank’s website or, if available, on the foodbank page on this site.
While food is always appreciated foodbanks have also need of funds for a variety of reasons. On a practical manner money is necessary to keep the utilities working and to provide maintenance services if a volunteer is not available. Additionally, money donated can also be used for extra services such as financial advice and to support community groups.
Whether it be a few cans of beans or a £10 donation, every little bit helps keep the foodbank able to help those in need.</p>
